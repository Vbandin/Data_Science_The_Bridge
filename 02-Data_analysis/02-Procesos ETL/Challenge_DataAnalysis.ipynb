You never show good newsNow in prophecy to the Danaansyou say archer Apollo brings us painbecause I was unwilling to acceptfine ransom for Chryses’ daughter ChryseisBut I have a great desire to take her homeIn fact I want her more than Clytaemnestrathe wife I married Chryseis is just as goodin her shape physique intelligence or workStill I’m prepared to give her back if that’s bestI want the people safe not all killed offBut then you will owe me another prizeI won’t be the only Argive left without a giftThat would be entirely unfair to meYou all can see my spoils are going elsewhereNoble son of Atreus most acquisitive of menhow can brave Achaeans give you a prize nowThere are none left for us to pass aroundWe’ve divided up what we allottedloot from captured towns we devastatedFor men to make a common pile againwould be most unfair Send the girl back nowas the god demands Should Zeus ever grantwe pillage Troy a city rich in goodswe’ll offer you three or four times as much” “Achilles you’re a fine man like a godBut don’t conceal what’s hidden in your heartYou’ll not deceive me or win me with your wordsYou intend to keep your prizes for yourselfwhile the army takes my trophy from meThat’s why you tell me to give Chryseis backLet Achaeans give me another prizeequal in value something I’ll enjoyIf not then I’ll take a prize myself by forcesomething from you or Ajax or OdysseusThe man I visit is going to be enragedBut let’s postpone discussion of all thisLet’s drag a black ship to the sacred seaselect a crew load oxen on for sacrificeand Chryseis that fair-complexioned girlLet’s have as leader some wise counsellor—Idomeneus Ajax godlike Odysseusor you Peleus’s son most eminent of allso with an offering we may appease the god who shoots from far awayYou insatiable creature quite shamelessHow can any Achaean obey you willingly—join a raiding party or keep fightingwith full force against an enemyI did not come to battle over herebecause of Trojans I have no fight with themThey never stole my bulls or horsesor destroyed my crops in fertile Phthiawhere heroes grow Many shady mountainsand the roaring sea stand there between usBut you great shameless man we came with youto please you to win honour from the Trojans—for you dog face and for Menelaus You don’t consider this don’t think at allYou threaten now to confiscate the prizeI worked so hard for gift from Achaea’s sonsWhen we Achaeans loot some well-built Trojan townmy prizes never match the ones you getThe major share of war’s fury rests on meBut when we hand around the battle spoilsyou get much larger trophies Worn out in warI reach my ships with something fine but smallSo I’ll return home now to PhthiaIt’s far better to sail back in my curved shipsI don’t fancy staying here unvaluedto pile up riches treasures just for youFly off home then if that’s your heart’s desireI’ll not beg you to stay on my accountI have others around to honour meespecially all-wise Zeus himselfOf all the kings Zeus cherishes it’s youI hate the most You love constant strife—war and combat So what if you’re strongSome god gave you that So scurry off homeTake ships and friends Go rule your MyrmidonsI don’t like you or care about your rageBut I’ll make this threat I’ll take your prizefair-cheeked Briseis I’ll fetch her in personYou’ll see just how much I’m the better manAnd others will hate to speak to me as peersin public claiming full equality with me”As Agamemnon spoke Peleus’s son Achilleswas overwhelmed with anguish heart torn two waysdebating in his shaggy chest what he should doShould he draw out the sharp sword on his thighincite the crowd kill Atreus’s son or suppress his ragecontrol his fury As he argued in his mind and hearthe slid his huge sword part way from its sheathAt that moment Athena came down from heavenWhite-armed Hera sent her She cherished both mencared for them equally Athena stood behind Achillesgrabbed him by his golden hair invisible to allexcept Achilles In astonishment he turnedAt once he recognized Pallas Athenathe dreadful glitter in her eyes Achilles spoke—his words had wings“Child of aegis-bearing Zeuswhy have you come now Do you wish to seehow overbearing Agamemnon isI’ll tell you where all this is going to lead—that arrogance will soon cost him his life” “I came down from heaven to curb your passionif you obey White-armed Hera sent meShe loves you both alike cares equallyGive up this quarrel Don’t draw your swordFight him with words so he becomes disgracedFor I say to you and this will happenbecause of Agamemnon’s arrogancesome day gifts three times greater than this girlwill be set down before you Control yourselfObeyGoddess men should follow your instructionsthough angry in their hearts It’s better soThe person who’s obedient to the godsthe gods attend to all the more” Obeying Athena’s wordsAchilles relaxed his huge fist on the silver hiltand pushed the massive sword back in its scabbard Athena then returned to heaven home of Zeuswho bears the aegis and the other godsAchilles turned again on Agamemnon Atreus’s sonwith harsh abuse his anger still unabated“You drunken sot dog-eyed deer-timid cowardyou’re never strong enough within yourselfto arm for war alongside other comradesor venture with Achaea’s bravest on a raidTo you that smells too much like deathNo You’d much prefer to stroll aroundthroughout the wide Achaean armyto grab gifts from a man who speaks against youA king who gorges on his own people!You lord it over worthless men If notson of Atreus this would be your last offenceI’ll tell you swear a great oath on this pointby this sceptre which will never sproutleaves and shoots again since first ripped awayfrom its mountain stump nor bloom any morenow that bronze has sliced off leaf and barkThis sceptre Achaea’s sons take in handwhenever they do justice in Zeus’s nameAn oath on this has power On this I swear—the time will come when Achaea’s sonsall miss Achilles a time when in distressyou’ll lack my help a time when Hectorthat man killer destroys many warriorsThen grief will tear your hearts apartbecause you shamed Achaea’s finest man”So the son of Peleus spoke throwing to the groundthe sceptre with the golden studs Then he sat downdirectly facing furious AgamemnonThen Nestor stood up clear sweet orator from PylosSweeter than honey the words flowed from his tongueIn his own lifetime two generations of mortal menhad come and passed away all those born and raisedwith him so long ago in sacred PylosNow he ruled a third generation of his peopleConcerned about their common good he said“Alas this is great sorrow for AchaeansPriam and Priam’s children will be gladthe hearts of other Trojans swell with joyshould they find out about such quarrellinga fight between you two among Danaansthe very best for counsel or combatBut listen You are both younger men than IAnd I’ve been colleague of better men than youmen who never showed me any disrespectmen whose like I have not seen againand never will—like Peirithous Dryas a shepherd to his people CaeneusExadios god-like PolyphemusTheseus son of Aegeus all god-like men—the mightiest earthborn men the strongestAnd the enemies they fought against were strongthe most powerful of mountain centaursBut they destroyed those creatures totallyAssociate of theirs I came from Pylosa long way from that land summoned personally I fought on my own behalf by myselfNo man alive on earth could now fight themYet they heard me and followed my adviceSo listen both of you That’s what’s best nowAgamemnon you’re an excellent manbut do not take Briseis from AchillesLet that pass Achaea’s sons gave her to him firstAnd you Peleus’s son don’t seek to fight the kingnot as your enemy The sceptre-bearing kingwhose powerful authority comes from Zeusnever shares honours equally Achillesyou may be stronger since your mother was divinebut he’s more powerful for he rules more menBut you son of Atreus check your angerSet aside I urge you your rage against Achilleswho provides in the middle of war’s evilsa powerful defence for all AchaeansOld man everything you say is true enoughBut this man wants to put the rest to shamerule all of us lord it over everyone But some I think will not obey himSo what if the gods who live forevermade him a spearman Is that some reasonwe should let him say such shameful thingsI’d be called a coward a nobodyif I held back from any actionbecause of something you might sayOrder other men about Don’t tell mewhat I should do I’ll not obey you anymoreBut I will tell you this—remember it well—I’ll not raise my hand to fight about that girlno not against you or any other manYou Achaeans gave her to me and nowyou seize her back again But you’ll not takeanother thing from my swift black ship—you’ll get nothing else with my consentIf you’d like to see what happens just tryMy spear will quickly drip with your dark blood”Thus the pair of them continued arguingThen they stood up dissolving the assembly by the shipsPeleus’s son went back to his well-balanced ships and hutsalong with Patroclus Menoetius’ son and friendsAgamemnon dragged a swift ship down the shorechose twenty sailors loaded on the oxenofferings for the god and led on fair-cheeked Chryseis Shrewd Odysseus shipped on as leader All aboardthey set off carving a pathway through the seaAtreus’s son ordered troops to cleanse themselvesThe men bathed in the sea washed off impuritiesThey then made sacrificial offerings to Apollo—hundreds of perfect bulls and goats—beside the restless seaSavoury smells curled up amid the smoke high into heavenThe men thus occupied Agamemnon did not forgetthe challenge he made earlier to AchillesHe called his heralds Talthybius and Eurybates“Go to Achilles’ tent Peleus’s sontake fair-complexioned Briseis by the handBring her to me If he won’t surrender herI’ll come myself in force and take herFor him that will be a worse disaster”With these firm orders he dismissed the men who moved offheavy hearted along the shore of the restless seaThey reached the huts and ships of the MyrmidonsThere they found Achilles seated by his hutand his black ship As he saw them approachAchilles felt no joy The two heralds afraidjust stood in silence out of deference to the kingIn his heart Achilles sensed their purpose He called them“Cheer up heralds messengers for gods and menCome here I don’t blame you but AgamemnonHe sends you both here for the girl BriseisCome Patroclus born from Zeus fetch the girlGive her to these two to take awayLet them both witness before blessed godsmortal men and that unfeeling kingif ever there’s a need for me againto defend others from a shameful deathThat man’s wits are foolish disastrously so—he’s not thinking about past or futurehow Achaeans may fight safely by their ships”Patroclus did as his dear comrade had requestedHe led out fair-cheeked Briseis from the hutand gave her up to be led off The heralds leftreturning to Achaean ships Briseis with thembut against her will Achilles then in tearswithdrew from his companions sat by the shorestaring at the wide grey seas Stretching out his handshe cried aloud praying repeatedly to Thetishis beloved mother “Mother since you gave me life—if only for a while—Olympian Zeushigh thunderer should give me due honourBut he does not grant me even slight respectFor wide-ruling Agamemnon Atreus’s sonhas shamed me has taken away my prizeappropriated it for his own use” As he said this he weptHis noble mother heard him from deep within the seawhere she sat by her old father Quickly she rose upmoving above grey waters like an ocean mistand settled down before him as he wept She stroked him then said  “My child why these tears What sorrowsweigh down your heart Tell me so we’ll both knowDon’t hide from me what’s on your mindYou know Why should I tell you what you knowWe came to Thebe Eëtion’s sacred citysacked it taking everything the city hadAchaea’s sons apportioned it all fairlyamongst themselves Agamemnon’s sharewas fair-skinned Chryseis Then Chryses arrivedat the swift ships of bronze-armed AchaeansArcher god Apollo’s priest sought out his daughterHe brought with him an enormous ransomcarried in his hands the sacred golden staffwith the shawl of archer god ApolloHe begged Achaeans above all Atreus’ two sonsthe people’s leaders All Achaeans called on themto respect the priest accept the splendid ransomBut that didn’t please Agamemnon in his heartHe sent him roughly off with harsh abusive ordersThe old man went away again enragedHe prayed to Apollo who loved him wellThe god heard him and sent his deadly arrowsagainst the Argives The troops kept dyingone by one as the god rained arrows downthroughout the wide Achaean armyThe prophet Calchas understanding alltold us Apollo’s will At once I was the firstto recommend we all appease the godBut anger got control of AgamemnonHe stood up on the spot and made that threatwhich he’s just carried out So quick-eyed Achaeansare sending Chryseis in fast ships back to Chrysetransporting gifts for lord Apollo and heralds cameto take away Briseis from my hutsthe girl who is my gift from Achaea’s sonsSo now if you can protect your sonGo to Mount Olympus and implore Zeusif ever you in word or deed have pleased himFor often I have heard you boast in father’s housethat you alone of all the deathless godssaved Zeus of the dark clouds from disgraceful ruinwhen other Olympians came to tie him upHera Pallas Athena and PoseidonBut you goddess came and set him freeby quickly calling up to high Olympusthat hundred-handed monster gods call Briareosand men all name Aigaion a creaturewhose strength was greater than his father’sHe sat down beside the son of Cronosexulting in his glory The sacred gods afraidstopped tying up Zeus So sit down right by Zeusclasp his knee remind him of all thatso he’ll want to help the Trojans somehowcorner Achaeans by the sea by their ships’ prowshave them destroyed so they all enjoy their king so the son of Atreus wide-ruling Agamemnonhimself may see his foolishness dishonouringAchilles the best of the AchaeansO my child why did I nurture yousince I brought you up to so much painWould you were safely by your ships dry-eyedYour life is fated to be short—you’ll not live longNow faced with a quick doom you’re in distressmore so than any other man At homeI gave you life marked by an evil fateBut I’ll tell these things to thunder-loving ZeusI’ll go myself to snow-topped Mount Olympusto see if he will undertake all thisMeanwhile you should sit by your swift shipsangry at Achaeans Take no part in warFor yesterday Zeus went to Oceanusto banquet with the worthy EthiopiansThe gods all journeyed with him In twelve dayswhen he returns and comes home to OlympusI’ll go to Zeus’s bronze-floored house clasp his kneeI think I’ll get him to consent” Thetis spokeThen she went away leaving Achilles thereangry at heart for lovely girdled Briseistaken from him by force against his willOdysseus sailed to Chryse bringing with himthe sacrificial animals as sacred offeringsWhen they had sailed into deep anchoragethey took in the sails and stowed them in the shipWith forestays they soon set the mast down in its notchthen rowed the ship in to its mooring placeThey threw out anchor stones lashed stern cablesand clambered out into the ocean surfThey brought off the offerings to archer god ApolloThen Chryseis disembarked from the ocean shipResourceful Odysseus led her to the altarplaced her in her beloved father’s hands then said“Chryses I have been sent by Agamemnonruler of men to bring your daughter to youand then on behalf of the Danaansto make an offering to lord Apollo—all these sacrificial beasts—to placate the godwho now inflicts such dismal evil on us”After saying this he handed the girl overChryses gave his daughter a joyful welcome backAnd then around the well-built altar they arrangedthe splendid sacrifice They washed their handsand picked up the barley grain for sprinklingRaising his arms Chryses prayed out loud on their behalf “Hear me god of the silver bow protectorof Chryse mighty lord of holy Cillasacred Tenedos You heard me earlierwhen I prayed to you Just as you honoured mestriking hard against Achaeans then so nowgrant me what I pray for—remove disasterthis wretched evil from the Danaans”So Chryses spoke Phoebus Apollo heard himOnce they had prayed and scattered barley grainthey pulled back the heads of sacrificial beastsslit their throats flayed them sliced the thigh bones outand hid them in twin layers of fat with raw meat on top Old Chryses burned them on split wood poured wine on themYoung men beside him held out five-pronged forksOnce the thighs were well burned they sampled entrailsthen sliced up all the rest skewered the meat on spitsroasted it carefully and drew off every pieceThat work complete they then prepared a meal and ateNo heart was left unsatisfied All feasted equallyAnd when the men had had their fill of food and drinkyoung boys filled the mixing bowl with wine up to the brimand served it pouring libations into every cupThen all day long young Achaean lads played musicsinging to the god a lovely hymn of praisehonouring in dance and song the god who shoots from far Hearing them Apollo felt joy fill his heart At sunsetas dusk came on by the ship’s stern they went to sleepBut when early born rose-fingered Dawn appearedthey set off once more back to the wide Achaean campFar-shooting Apollo sent them favourable windsThey raised the mast and then the sails The wind blew filling out the body of the sail—on both sides of the prowthe purple waves hissed loudly as the ship sped on its wayits motion carving a path through the ocean swellWhen they reached the broad Achaean armythey hauled the black ship high up on the sandpushed long props tight beneath it then dispersedeach man returning to his own huts and shipsMeanwhile Achilles divinely born son of Peleussat down in anger alongside his swift ships Not oncedid he attend assembly where men win gloryor go out to fight But he pined away at heartremaining idle by his ships yearningfor the hue and cry and clash of battleTwelve days later the company of gods came back together to Olympus with Zeus in the leadThetis did not forget the promise to her sonShe rose up through the ocean waves at daybreakthen moved high up to great Olympus She found Zeuswide-seeing son of Cronos some distance from the restseated on the highest peak of many-ridged OlympusShe sat down right in front of him With her left handshe clutched his knees with her right she cupped his chinin supplication to lord Zeus son of Cronos“Father Zeus if among the deathless godsI’ve ever served you well in word or deedthen grant my prayer will be fulfilledBring honour to my son who of all menwill be fate’s quickest victim For just nowAgamemnon king of men has shamed himHe seized his prize robbing him in personand kept it for himself But honour himZeus all-wise Olympian Give the Trojansthe upper hand until Achaeans respect my sonuntil they multiply his honours” Thetis finished Cloud gatherer Zeus did not respondHe sat a long time silent Thetis held his kneesclinging close repeating her request once more“Promise me truly nod your head or deny me—since there’s nothing here for you to fear—so I’ll clearly see how among the godsI enjoy the least respect of all” “A nasty businessWhat you say will set Hera against meShe provokes me so with her abuse Even nowin the assembly of immortal godsshe’s always insulting me accusing meof favouring the Trojans in the warBut go away for now in case Hera catches onI’ll take care of this make sure it comes to passCome to convince you I’ll nod my headAmong gods that’s the strongest pledge I makeOnce I nod my assent nothing I saycan be revoked denied or unfulfilled”Zeus son of Cronos nodded his dark browsThe divine hair on the king of gods fell forwarddown over his immortal head shaking Olympusto its very base The conference over the two partedThetis plunged from bright Olympus back into the seaZeus went inside his house Their father presentall the gods at once stood up from their seatsNo one dared stay put as he came in—all rose togetherZeus seated himself upon his throne Looking at himHera sensed he had made some deal with Thetissilver-footed daughter of the Old Man of the SeaAt once she spoke up accusingly “Which god has been scheming with you you crafty one You always love to work on things in secretwithout involving me You never wantto tell me openly what you intend” “Heradon’t hope to understand my every planEven for my own wife that’s dangerousWhat’s appropriate for you to hear aboutno one god or man will know before youBut when I wish to hide my thoughts from godsdon’t you go digging after themor pestering me for every detail” “Most dread son of Cronos what are you sayingI have not been overzealous before nowin questioning you or seeking answersSurely you’re quite at liberty to plananything you wish But now in my mindI’ve got this dreadful fear that Thetissilver-footed daughter of the Old Man of the Seahas won you over for this morning earlyshe sat down beside you held your kneesI think you surely nodded your agreementto honour Achilles killing many soldiersslaughtering them by the Achaean shipsMy dear lady you’re always fancying thingsYour attention picks up every detailBut you can’t do anything about itexcept push yourself still further from my heartmaking matters so much worse for youIf things are as they are then that’s the wayI want them So sit down quietlyDo as I say If not then all the godshere on Olympus won’t be any helpwhen I reach out to set my hands on youfor they’re invincible” Zeus finished speakingOx-eyed queen Hera was afraid—so she sat downsilently suppressing what her heart desired In Zeus’s home the Olympian gods began to quarrelThen that famous artisan Hephaestus concernedabout his mother white-armed Hera spoke to them“A troublesome matter this will prove—unendurable—if you two start fightingover mortal men like this inciting gods to quarrel If we start bickering we can’t enjoy the mealour excellent banquet So I’m urging motherthough she’s more than willing to humour Zeusour dear father so he won’t get angry once again disturb the feast for us For if Zeusthe Olympian lord of lightning was of a mindto hurl us from our seats his strength’s too greatBut if you talk to him with soothing wordsat once Olympian Zeus will treat us well”Hephaestus spoke then stood up passed a double gobletacross to his dear mother saying to her“Stay calm mother even though you are upsetIf not then as beloved as you areI may see you beaten up before my eyeswith me incapable of helping outthough the sight would make me most unhappyIt’s hard to take a stand opposing ZeusOnce when I was eager to assist you Zeus seized me by the feet and threw me outdown from heaven’s heights The entire dayI fell and then right at sunset droppedon Lemnos almost dead After that fallmen of Sintes helped me to recover”As he spoke the white-armed goddess Hera smiledShe reached for her son’s goblet He poured the drinkgoing from right to left for all the other godsdrawing off sweet nectar from the mixing bowlThen their
